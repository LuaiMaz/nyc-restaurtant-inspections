# NYC Restaurant Inspection Analysis

This project analyzes **319,806+ New York City restaurant inspection records (2015â€“2022)** from the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j).  
The analysis was completed as part of my **COOP Data Analytics Fellowship** to practice real-world data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and storytelling.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning (Excel)**  
  - Cleaned and structured 319K+ records, fixing nulls, invalid boroughs, placeholder dates, and duplicates.  
  - Created a primary key to track restaurants across inspections.  

- **Analysis (Excel)**  
  - Used pivot tables and charts to explore failures by borough, cuisine, and violation type.  
  - Summarized top violations and geographic hotspots.  

- **Visualization (Tableau & PowerPoint)**  
  - Built dashboards in Tableau (collaborative work, not hosted here).  
  - Compiled insights into a one-pager and final presentation slides.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Manhattan** accounted for **1/3 of all failures** despite only 20% of NYCâ€™s population.  
- **Top 10 ZIP codes** made up **18% of all violations**, with East Village, Midtown, and Times Square leading.  
- **Critical violations = 52%** of all failures (temperature control, pests, contamination).  
- **Infrastructure (35%)** and **pest control (23%)** were the primary drivers of failures, more than food handling.
